# Monkey-Malware
Personal ransomware project for Windows. Subject to change and updates. Only for personal and educative purposes, I am not responsible for someone else's attempts at using this malware.

The main objective being the encryption of a target directory (C:/Users) plus some ownership and permission modifications on the Windows directories, especially the System files one. Before encryption, an email with an attachment including the encryption key is sent to the attacker address, from the victim's address. After performing the encryption process, this malware would also attack one or multiples Windows processes (explorer.exe, powershell, taskmanager ...) in order to restrain the victim's ability to react and obstruct countermeasures. The last goal is to delete, create and save a new malicious key in the Windows register, which attritubed value would trigger the main executable file everytime the system boots, preventing the malware from being countered by a simple computer restart.

The whole project is coded in Python 3.7.9, and is compiled via the cx-Freeze module. The main executable can then be stored into a winrar archive, or made into an installer which can be renamed in order to trick the victim.
